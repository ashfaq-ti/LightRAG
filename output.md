# **HCTRA Account Types**

#### **Account Types & Plans**

Accounts are created for two (2) reasons:

{page : 29}------------------------------------------------

- The customer reached out to HCTRA to request an account.
- The vehicle image was captured on the tollway and an account was generated.

## *The type of accounts that the CSR will create and/or maintain will depend upon their job duties.*

# **EZ TAG Account Types**

## **Personal EZ TAG Account**

- Prepaid account opened by a customer set to auto-charge
- Funded by EFT (bank account), credit card, or debit card
- EZ Plate only is an option

# **Large EZ TAG Account**

- Personal EZ TAG Accounts that include 20 or more active vehicles
- May also be a Corporate, Invoiced or Fleet Account Type and Plan
- Transfer large account customers to extension 3223.

## **Personal Non-Revenue Account (Active Military)**

- Personal Non-Revenue accounts created for active military individuals requesting free passage on HCTRA roads
- Must be opened at a Storefront location

## **Invoiced EZ TAG Account**

- Prepaid account that charges the customer three times their monthly usage as the replenishment amount. When payment is received, the account is replenished.
- Established invoiced accounts converted to credit card or EFT cannot be reverted back to invoiced.
- Transfer invoiced account customers to extension 3223.

# **Fleet Accounts**

- EZ TAG Accounts specially created to accommodate a large vehicle inventory.
- These may include specialized upload features to input a large amount of vehicles at once.
- If a customer is attempting to access or change a Fleet account, the CSR must transfer the call to BOS. Storefront CSRs will contact a Lead.

#### *Fleet accounts are not to be updated or notated by CSRs!*

# **Processing a Payment in Rite 2.0**

{page : 30}------------------------------------------------

# **Accepting Credit Card information**

- **Call Center Representatives** are responsible for verifying the card number twice, the name and the billing address on the card
- **Storefront Representatives** triPOS will **not** automatically populate the card holder's name in the system once the customer has swiped the card. The storefront representative will be responsible for entering the name on the card into Rite 2.0. If the card holder's name does not match the customer's name and/or the card holder is not present with their ID, the card CANNOT be charged.
- Never type the credit card number outside of triPOS terminal
- Never repeat the customer's card information
- Always verify payment amounts **BEFORE** asking customers to swipe card into triPOS or requesting the card information

# **triPOS & NICE Recording System**

- triPOS and NICE (HCTRA's call recording system) will work together to ensure that the customers card information is secured by muting the card number from the call recording. This also prevents the card number from being seen on the screen recording.
- If the customer begins to provide the card number before you get to the secured credit card field, attempt to stop the customer by letting them know that the system is not ready. For security reasons, at no point should a customer credit card information be captured on a recorded line.
- To ensure that CSR's remain PCI compliant, it is important that the following steps are followed.

# **Adding a Credit Card Using triPOS**

- 1. Select Credit Card from the drop down menu. If applicable (this options should only be selected if the customer confirms the billing information matches what is currently on file)
- 2. Ask the customer if they have their credit card information ready before selecting **TypeIn CC**
	- a. In the event the customer begins to read off their credit card information before you select **TypeIn CC** politely interrupt the customer and inform them, for security reasons please allow you to get to the credit card screen.
- 3. Select **TypeIn CC** from the "TriPOS Add Credit Card" pop-up.

**Note**: Do not select **TypeIn CC** unless the customer is ready to provide you their credit card information. The TriPOS system times out within 1 minute of selecting **TypeIn CC**.

# **Canceling a triPOS Transaction**

- If the customer interjects while attempting to type in the credit card number, select the red "**X**" on the TriPOS to cancel transaction.
- Next, select "OK" on the pop-up on your screen. See below.

# **Violation Processing**

# **Violation Enforcement System**

{page : 31}------------------------------------------------

On January 23, 1996, the Harris County Commissioners Court ordered that effective February 1, 1996, no vehicle may be operated on any County toll project for which a toll or charge has been legally imposed if the operator has failed to pay a required toll or charge pursuant to section 284 of the Texas Transportation Code. As an action allowed by the approval of this order, the Toll Violation Enforcement section was established within the Harris County Toll Road Authority.

The Harris County Toll Road Authority is currently collecting toll violation images from 1238 cameras installed throughout the system. Rear Plate Cameras – 691 – two cameras per lane except for 1 lane at the bridge where we only have a single camera on a narrow shoulder. Front Plate Cameras – 547 – 2 cameras per AVI Only lanes except for 1 lane at the bridge where we only have a single camera on a narrow shoulder.

On average, 5.8 million toll violation events are captured by the system every month. The Toll Violation Enforcement section is currently reviewing 275K average reviews returned each day by Image Review and issuing an average of 91,667 Toll Violation Invoices per day.

On May 2, 2000, the Harris County Commissioners Court approved the adoption of an administrative adjudication hearing procedure for persons who failed to pay toll violation invoices received from the Toll Road Authority. The Toll Road Authority is currently working in partnership with the Harris County Attorney's Office and outside legal counsel to maintain the administrative hearing efforts. At least 800 cases per month are being presented in administrative hearings. Monthly, an average of 95 vehicle registration records are being flagged as "scofflaw" for failure to pay tolls as a result of this effort.

- 3. During the Administrative Hearing process a judge will listen to arguments presented by the Toll Road Authority and by the toll violator and issue an Order of Judgment. The Order of Judgment will indicate the Judge's ruling and determine the final amount due. As a part of the ruling, the Judge has the option to assess additional fines and costs, flag (block) the vehicle registration, or place a device (boot) on the vehicle prohibiting movement until the outstanding tolls and fees are paid.
- 4. If payment for tolls, charges, fees or costs is not received within thirty-one days of the hearing decision being filed with the County Clerk's office, registration of the vehicle will be blocked.

# *Note: Failure to appear at the hearing is considered an admission of liability and the hearing officer may issue an order assessing a fine and costs on that basis.*

- If the Violator Account has been flagged with the bad Address Alert, Skip Tracing occurs on the 31st day from the original Mail Date.
- If a new address is located, the invoice is then reissued with a new mail date and due date.
- If HCTRA is unable to locate another address, the invoice escalates to Collections
- **Paying Tolls & Invoices Online**
- When a customer enters their license plate on hctra.org to pay their tolls and invoices, the website will return "everything owed".

- The customer will see all un-invoiced transactions, invoices, open payment plan alerts, as well as other plates with an outstanding balance that may be on the same EZ TAG account. The customer will be able to manually select which items they would like to pay and for how much
- If the customer searches on License Plate only, invoice numbers will be masked.
- When the customer enters license plate and invoice number, full invoice numbers will display for all invoices that are on the same account in RITE. Any invoices from a different account in RITE will be masked for privacy reasons. The other account(s) could belong to someone else.
- A customer is allowed to partially pay an invoice, but an invoice must be paid in its entirety to be eligible for any applicable discount.

{page : 49}------------------------------------------------

- The Discount amount will decrease when items are unselected or when only partial payment is being made for an "eligible-for-adjustment" invoice.

{page : 67}------------------------------------------------

Flex Pay accounts can be opened in-store, or over the phone. Call Center agents will use the following script when creating Flex Pay accounts by phone:

# *"Mr./Mrs. Customer to establish your account by phone, a onetime payment using a credit card is needed to fund the account."*

Customers with Flex Pay Accounts will have the ability to manage their account via hctra.org or the traditional EZ TAG app.

To avoid receiving violations, Flex Pay Account **must** remain in good standing.

*TIP – Suspicious Activity Alert*

## **Excessive Credit Card Declines**

- CSC Procedure- Excessive Credit Card Declines outlines a procedure on when a customer's credit card has reached the maximum number of declines.
- Inform the customer they need to use a different payment method because there have been too many declines on their card.
- If the customer is adamant about using their "excessively declined" card, transfer them to your management team for assistance.

#### *CSC Procedure- Excessive Credit Card Declines*

# **TIP – Credit Card Decline ("Prevented") Codes**

HCTRA will now prevent the usage of credit cards that have received a particular decline code. These codes are referred to as "Prevented" in the RITE system. Once a credit card has been marked as "Prevented", that card can no longer be used to make payment anywhere in HCTRA's system (e.g., CSC, website, auto-charge, etc.).

# *HCTRA IVR*

{page : 72}------------------------------------------------

HCTRA released a new IVR (Interactive Voice Recognition) technology to enhance the customer experience.

The IVR system assists customers with following:

- Customers can hear general information
- Activating Pending EZ Tag(s)
- Hear EZ Tag account balance
- Resetting online access
- Making a payment
- Updating billing information

Customers with open unpaid balances will be able to

- Hear balance owed
- Make a payment

Customers can opt to transfer to a CSR at anytime. If it is outside of business hours the customer will need to call back

What is not handled by IVR?

# **Calls will be transferred to a CSR when:**

- IVR cannot find or verify an account based on the customer's phone number and zip entered
- Multiple accounts match caller phone number
- Caller is seeking assistance outside the offered functions
- Caller has outstanding **account fee(s) (e.g., NSF fee)**
- Payment cannot be made with new bank account / EFT
- Caller owes more than the IVR's threshold values (to avoid a timeout)
- A payment is taking too long
- Other unforeseen errors

# **Verifying the caller –**

- If the transferred call indicates successful authentication ("authenticated=Y") the CSR is only required to confirm the name on the account.
- The CSR should assist the customer as they would any other caller, with the bonus of the IVR transfer providing caller intent details (what the customer was attempting to do)
- Please reference TIP-HCTRA IVR for caller intent values

# **Account Maintenance: Need to Know**

# **Closing the Account**

- The Account Holder may close their account online or submit a "Request to Change Account Status" form. Authorized Contacts may not close the account.

# **Adding New Vehicle**

**Important Facts**

- **CHECK FOR VIOLATIONS** before adding the license plate to the account!
- The customer must agree to resolve violations before a new EZ TAG is issued.
- Verify the customer has enough available funds on the account to cover the cost of a new EZ TAG without being below the low-level balance.
- The letters 'I' and 'O' are not standard issued Texas license plates. Please ask customers to verify if they mean the numbers '1' or '0'.
- Temporary license plates will have all numbers and one letter. For example: "09876B6"

# *Please refer to the TIP-Temporary License Checkbox*

# **Vehicles Stuck in Proposed**

A vehicle occasionally gets stuck in a proposed status when:

- A CSR encounters the "One Step check out failed" error message when attempting to add a new vehicle tag.

- **Pending Activation Tags**: If you see "Pending Activation" next to an EZ TAG, always verify if the customer has the tag. Offer to activate the EZ TAG only if the customer has the tag.

## *Note: Tolls will only post to the account after the vehicle has been added. Tolls that occurred prior to adding the vehicle must be addressed separately.*

# **Rental Cars & Violations**

# **Checking for Violations**

#### **How to Check For Violations**

There are two ways to check for violations:

- Account Search in the license plate and/or invoice field.
- Advanced Search in the transaction field.
	- o Always select "Open" under transaction status.

## **Reasons for Violations**

- The account did not have funds at the time of toll usage (auto-charge reject, credit card expired, or no payment method is on file).
- Customer failed to update the license plate for a vehicle on the account.

## **Pay Using EZ Tag Account**

## **CSRs are able to take payment for a Violator account from an EZ TAG account!**

- Anything added to the Violator account Cart (Uninvoiced, Fee reduction, adjustments, etc.) can be paid using an EZ TAG account.
- If the EZ TAG account's balance is not enough to cover the payment and/or the balance will fall below the account's low balance, the system will calculate the required amount and prompt for that payment.
- The vehicle on the Violator account may be available to transfer to the EZ TAG account. Ensure all of the vehicle information is complete before requesting an Ez TAG for the vehicle.
- A vehicle that has already been End Dated on the Violator account will not transfer. The ability to transfer an End Dated vehicle will be a future enhancement.
- Partial payment is allowed.
- Do not transfer a vehicle to an Express account.
